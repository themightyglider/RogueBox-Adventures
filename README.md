1.) What kind of game is RogueBox Adventures?

    RBA is a mixture out of Roguelike and Sandbox game. But what does this mean?
    

    According to Wikipedia: 

    "Roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing video games, characterized by procedural generation of game levels, turn-based gameplay, 
    tile-based graphics, permanent death of the player-character, and typically based on a high fantasy narrative setting."

    But RBA dosn't cover all of this points.

    - It definitely features procedural generated levels. The whole gameworld is generated randomly for every new game.
    - It's gameplay is turnebased but the player has only a limited time to make the next turn (2sec) otherwise the game will go on
    - It uses tile-based graphics (but no ASCII graphics like clasic Roguelikes)
    - It is possible to play with permanent death but it isn't necessary
    - THere are monsters like orcs and dryades and items like magic scrolls and weapons inside RBA. So yes, it has got some kind of high
      fantasy setting

    Sandbox games on the other hand are a special kind of open-world-game which is about the interaction between the player and the 
    game-world. Everything is about changing the gameworld.
    RBA is definatly a game about changing the gameworld by interacting with it. So you can call it a sandbox game with some rogue-like elements...
    ...Or you simply can call it a RogueBox-game.

2.) Were can I get the game? On witch platforms does it run?

    You can download a build of RBA at: https://github.com/themightyglider/RogueBox-Adventures/releases

    It is distributed in three ways:

    - A Windows-Standalone to run the game on Microsoft Windows PC's
    - A .apk file to install the game on a Android-Device like a smartphone or a tablet
    - A Source-Release that should be runable on any system with a working installation of Python2.7 and pygame. (So the game also runs on OSX,
      Linux, BSD* and so on) You can download Python at: https://www.python.org/ and pygame at: http://pygame.org. Afterward simply run the 
      file main.py from the main directory of RBA.

3.) What is about the version numbers?
    
    The first number will be changed when the new version isn't compatible with the save files of the old version.
    That means a saved game from version 1.0 will be playable on version 1.2 for example but not on version 2.0.
    The second number is changed by every release with bugfixes and smaller new features.

4.) How do I Play? what are the keybindings?

    RBA can be played with the keybord, mouse/touchscreen or a gamepad.

    The keybindings are:

    w,a,s,d/Arrow-keys/gamepad hat : Move/Navigate trough the menus
    e/ENTER/gamepad Button1        : Interaction/Choose/Use
    i/BACKSPACE/gamepad Button4    : Open Inventory
    b/Space/gamepad Button3        : Open Build menu/Switch mode/Done/Drop
    x/ESCAPE/gamepad Button2       : Open main menu/Abrot/Back
    f       /gamepad Button5       : Fire mode on/off

5.) I've found a bug. I want to make a suggestion.
